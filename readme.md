This is a Fully Responsive Project Built with `t3`, `stripe`, `prisma`, `trpc`, `supabase.io`, `nextjs`, `faker.js`, `tailwind` `react-query`, `AWS Route53` and a few other libraries.

## What does this do?

This is a complete e-commerce application, Ui was not the main focus, but the aim was to create a site that featured login for users and staff, even featuring a staff dashboard where insights into the business can be viewed all in one repository for both backend and front end.
